# Skill: Google Code Wiki Integration (codewiki)

Connects OpenClaw agents to [codewiki.ai](https://codewiki.ai) to ingest AI-generated documentation, architecture diagrams, and knowledge graphs.

## Description
This skill enables agents to "read" the deep architectural insights generated by Google's Code Wiki platform. Since the official CLI is waitlist-gated, this skill uses browser-based extraction to fetch knowledge from the web interface.

## Tools

### `codewiki.ingest`
Navigates to the project's Code Wiki URL and extracts the high-level summary, diagrams, and key definitions.
**Usage**: `codewiki.ingest("https://codewiki.ai/p/your-project")`

### `codewiki.query`
Uses the Code Wiki chat interface to ask specific repository-level questions and returns the cited code context.
**Usage**: `codewiki.query("https://codewiki.ai/p/your-project", "How does the auth flow work?")`

## Instructions
1.  Always check the Code Wiki for architecture diagrams before proposing major refactors.
2.  If the user mentions a "Knowledge Graph" or "Wiki diagram," use `codewiki.ingest`.
3.  Prefer Code Wiki's citations over raw file searches for complex cross-module dependencies.
